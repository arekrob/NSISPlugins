The plugins here are in polish language version.

Here you can find WORKING plugins for NSIS Unicode which check if
* .NET Framework 2.0.50727
* .NET Framework 4.0
* Windows Imaging Component

or

* Windows Installer 3.1

is installed and installs the software if needed.

Contrary to other plugins, these plugins properly run installers in passive mode (i.e. the installers ask the user no questions) and properly check if Windows needs to restart after installing.
